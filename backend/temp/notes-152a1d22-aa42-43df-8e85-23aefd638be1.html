          ## Thyroid Nodules and Cancer

### Benign Thyroid Nodules

### Thyroid Cancer

## Thyroid Nodule

### Prevalence

- Extraordinarily common
- Depends on:
    - Iodine deficiency
    - Ionizing radiation
    - Gender
    - Age
    - Method of detection (palpation, autopsy, or ultrasound)

_MazzaferriE, New Engl J Med 1993_


## Thyroid Cancer

### Incidence, Mortality, and Stage

_McLeod DSA et al, Lancet 2013 & Davies et al., JAMA 2006_


## Goiter

### Classification

- **Neoplastic Goiter:**
    - Benign
    - Malignant

- **Thyroiditis:**
    - Bacterial (acute suppurative)
    - Viral (subacute)
    - Lymphocytic/Hashimoto/Autoimmune (chronic)

- **Simple Goiter (Endemic or Sporadic):**
    - Diffuse
    - Nodular

- **Toxic Goiter:**
    - Diffuse toxic (Graves')
    - Toxic nodular (Plummer's)
    - Toxic/Functioning adenoma


## Thyroid Nodule

### Pathology

- Nodular goiter: colloid / hemorrhagic cystic / complex / hyperplastic / adenomatous nodule (70%)
- Benign follicular adenoma: mainly non-toxic (15%)
- Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (10%)
- Miscellaneous: other thyroid malignancies, thyroiditis (5%)


### Symptoms/Presentations

- Neck swelling/mass
- Pain or discomfort
- Local pressure symptoms/voice changes
- Thyroid dysfunction
- Incidental or unrelated findings on physical examination or imaging


## Investigations

- Blood tests: TSH + free T4
- Ultrasound
- FNAC (+ molecular testing)
- ESR, thyroid antibodies, calcitonin, genetic testing (as indicated)
- Imaging: radioisotope scan, CT scan/MRI, PET scan (as indicated)
- Endoscopy (as indicated)
- Thyroidectomy: diagnostic + therapeutic


### Ultrasonography (USG)

- B-mode real-time
- Non-invasive, no radiation, convenient, and inexpensive
- High sensitivity but relatively low specificity
- Role:
    - Extend physical examination
    - Select nodules for FNAC
    - Guide needle aspiration
    - For all patients with goiter/palpable nodule
    - Not recommended as a screening test

_Haugen BR, et al. Thyroid 2016_
_Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (TIRADS)_


### Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)

| Diagnostic Category | Risk of Malignancy | Usual Management |
|---|---|---|
| I. Non-diagnostic | 1-4% | Repeat FNA |
| II. Benign | 0-3% | Clinical follow-up |
| III. AUS or FLUS | 5-15% | Repeat FNA |
| IV. Follicular neoplasm | 15-30% | Surgical lobectomy |
| V. Suspicious of malignancy | 60-75% | Surgical lobectomy (FS) + TT |
| VI. Malignant | 97-99% | Total thyroidectomy (TT) |

_AUS: atypia of undetermined significance_
_FLUS: follicular lesion of undetermined significance_
_Bethesda classification_



### FNA Molecular Testing

- Somatic mutations
- BRAF: 40-64%
- Panel of mutations (Asuragen miRInform™): 63-80%
    - Not sensitive but specific: high PPV (rule-in test)
- Gene expression evaluation and miRNA classifier
- ThyroSeq v3 multigene genomic classifier (DNA-RNA)
- Afirma® genomic sequencing classifier (RNA)
    - Highly sensitive but not specific with high NPV (rule-out test)
- For indeterminate (CAT III-IV: FLUS/FN) nodule
- Avoid diagnostic thyroidectomy in 50%

### ATA Guidelines: Management of Thyroid Nodule

_Haugen BR, et al. Thyroid 2016_


### Other Investigations: Imaging and Endoscopy

- **Radioisotope Scintigraphy (I¹²³ or Tc⁹⁹ᵐ):**
    - Diagnosis of malignancy: low sensitivity and specificity
    - Functional assessment in thyrotoxic patients (Graves' disease, toxic adenoma, toxic nodular goiter, cold nodule)

- CXR (thoracic inlet)
- CT scan/MRI
- PET scan
- Endoscopy



## Benign Thyroid Nodules

### Indications for Treatment

- Symptomatic (size of goiter/nodule)
- Increase in goiter size
- Trachea compression or deviation
- Retrosternal extension
- Suspected malignancy
- Cosmetic considerations/patient wish


### Surgical Treatment

- **Unilateral Lobectomy (Hemithyroidectomy):**
    - For uninodular goiter
    - Safe, minimal morbidities, diagnosis and cure
    - Future reoperation on contralateral lobe without difficulty
    - Around 10-20% chance of hypothyroidism

- **Total/Near-Total Thyroidectomy (Bilateral Thyroidectomy):**
    - For symptomatic multinodular goiter
    - No recurrence/need for reoperation
    - Additional surgical risk (hypoparathyroidism)
    - Needs long-term thyroxine replacement

- **Partial or Bilateral Subtotal Thyroidectomy:**
    - Rarely indicated


### Nonsurgical Ablative Treatment

- Ethanol injection (PEI)
- High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)
- Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
- Percutaneous laser ablation (LA)
- Microwave ablation (MWA)

_Thermal coagulation necrosis_
_Cytoplasmic protein dehydration/coagulation necrosis_
_Cystic/predominantly cystic_
_Complex or solid nodule_
_Under LA or sedation_
_Clinic or day procedure_

_Grani-G, et al. JCEM 2020_


###  Nonsurgical Ablative Treatment (continued)

- Volume reduction rate (VRR: 50-80%)
- Patient Selection:
    - Symptomatic/single/hyperfunctioning nodule
    - <4-cm or 20mL/growth on sonogram
    - Benign (FNAC x2)
    - Motivated patients
- Expectations: preserve function, minimally invasive, avoiding general anesthesia, day procedure, scarless, cosmetic outcome
- Limitations: not curative, unsatisfactory shrinkage, regrowth, additional procedure, risk unique to ablation, expense



## Thyroid Carcinoma

### Major Histologic Types

- **Well-differentiated (90%):**
    - Papillary (90%)
    - Follicular (10%)

- Poorly differentiated (insular) (<5%)
- Undifferentiated (anaplastic) (<5%)
- Medullary carcinoma (<5%)
- Others (1%): lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoma, metastasis



## Well-Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma

### Management Considerations

- Extent of thyroidectomy: hemithyroidectomy vs. total (bilateral) thyroidectomy
- Nature/aim and extent of lymph node/neck dissection: prophylactic or therapeutic; central and/or lateral compartments
- Postoperative adjuvant therapies: radioiodine (I¹³¹) ablation, external beam irradiation, thyroxine (T₄) suppressive therapy


### Risk Groups

|  | Low Risk | High Risk |
|---|---|---|
| % of patients | 85-90% | 10-15% |
| Mortality (10-20 yrs) | 2-5% | 40-50% |
| Recurrence | 10% | 45% |



## Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC)

### Management Controversy for Low-Risk Patients

- Early stage: <4 cm, no invasion, no LN metastasis
- Majority as papillary microcarcinomas (PTMC): <1-cm
- Survival: nearly 100%
- Overtreatment/surgical risk vs. avoiding recurrence/facilitating follow-up
- Patient vs. physician preference
- Personalized treatment

| Total Thyroidectomy | Hemithyroidectomy |
|---|---|
| Commonly multifocal and bilateral | Excellent survival and low recurrence |
| Allows RAI ablation and thyroglobulin (Tg) monitoring | Avoid T₄ replacement |
|  | Lower morbidity rate by experienced surgeons |


### Cervical Lymph Nodes in PTC: Management

- **Central (level VI: pre- and para-tracheal):** same incision
    - Prophylactic/routine vs. therapeutic
    - Reduction in disease recurrence/reoperations
    - Upstaging disease and increased use of I¹³¹
    - Increased morbidity: hypoparathyroidism

- **Lateral (level II-V):** extended incision
    - Usually therapeutic
    - Clinically involved or FNAC proven nodes
    - Excisional (Berry-picking)
    - Modified/functional/selective neck dissection


### Adjuvant Therapy: Use of Radioiodine (I¹³¹) Ablation

- Follows total/near-total thyroidectomy
- Thyroxine withdrawal vs. thyrogen (recombinant TSH)
- **Therapy:** high risk (stage III/IV disease) - gross persistent/residual disease; nodal or distant metastases
- **Ablation:** low-risk (selected stage I and stage II) - destroy occult microscopic foci; facilitate disease surveillance; low dose (30mCi) as effective as higher dose (100 mCi); short- and long-term adverse effects

_Schlumberger M, et al. New Engl J Med 2012_


## Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma (PTMC)

### Definition and Relevance

- WHO: <1-cm + detected incidentally
- AJCC pTNM staging: <1-cm; majority pT1a or stage I disease; usually incidentally detected
- Low-risk or extremely low-risk
- Excellent or almost 100% survival
- Less aggressive treatment (lobectomy) or active observation


### Active Observation

- Biopsy-proven incidental PTMC
- No metastases/invasion/high-grade subtype
- Tumor progression (up to 20 years): increased size (3mm): 8%; novel nodal metastases: 3.5%
- Surgical treatment for tumor progression
- Feasible treatment option

_Choi YS, et al Thyroid 2020; Cho, SJ, et al Thyroid 2020; Yan L, et al. Thyroid 2021_


### Thermal Ablation

_Ito Y & Miyauchi A. Thyroid 2003; JCEM 2007; World J Surg 2010; Curr Opin Oncol 2015; Sugitani I al World J Surg 2010; Miyauchi A. World J Surg 2016; Thyroid 2017; Morinelo E, et al JCEM 2019_

- Meta-analysis and propensity matched analysis
- Complete ablation/volume reduction/safety
- Tumor progression, recurrence, nodal metastasis same as observation
- Possibly another alternative for PTMC without metastasis


## Thyroid Carcinoma: Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC)

- Calcitonin (basal/stimulated) as marker
- Total thyroidectomy
- Central + lateral neck dissection
- Familial cases (1/3):
    - MEN IIA
    - MEN IIB
    - Familial MTC
- Genetic analysis: RET proto-oncogene
- Prophylactic thyroidectomy (5-10 yrs)


## Thyroid Carcinoma: Anaplastic Carcinoma

- Elderly with poor co-morbid state
- Aggressive and rapidly growing
- Locally advanced disease
- Frequent distant metastases
- Lack of effective treatment
- Chemoirradiation + resection + targeted therapy
- Invariably palliative and fatal
